a. Validation for T1

T2 doesn't start/validate during validation/writing of T1. Hence T2 will not rollback.

T3 satify both the cases but
Intersection of R_D(T3) and W_S(T1) is NULL and
Intersection of W_S(T3) and W_S(T1) is also NULL.
Hence, T3 will not rollback.

T4 starts during validation/writing and Intersection of R_D(T4) and W_S(T1) is {A}.
Hence, T4 will be rollback and waits for T1 to finish.


b. Validation for T2

T1 reading/validation overlaps with validation/writing but Intersection of R_D(T1) and W_S(T2) is NULL
and intersection of W_S(T2) and W_S(T1) is also NULL.
Hence T1 will not rollback.

T3 reading/validation overlaps with validation/writing of T2 and intersection of WS(T3) and WS(T2) is {D}
Hence, T3 will rollback and wait for T2 to finish.

T4 starts after T2 finishes
Hence, it's serializable.


c. Validation for T3

T4 reading/validation overlaps with reading/validation and intersection of R_D(T4) and W_S(T3) is {D}.
Hence, T4 will rollback and wait for T3 to finish and then start.


d. Validation for T4

T1 and T2 may executes as given. 
T3 must wait for T2 to finish.
T4 must wait for T3 to finish.
